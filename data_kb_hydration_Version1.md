# Hydration Basics

- General guidance: about 2â€“3 liters of water per day for most adults, but needs vary by body size, activity, and climate.
- Signs you may be hydrated: pale yellow urine, stable energy, minimal thirst.
- Spread water intake throughout the day; add an extra glass with each meal.
- Consider more fluids during hot weather or exercise.
